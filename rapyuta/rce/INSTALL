Install and Platform Notes
==========================

1. Official support for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Fuerte.

2. Can be deployed on a platform of your choice:
        Virtualbox
        VMware
        IaaS such as AWS and RackSpace
        Local Commodity Machines

4. Understanding the Install Options:
   ==================================

    a. autoprovision mode: [ default: N ]
        Should not be used for production deployments, but only for development.
        The system will later prompt you to setup the passwords for the 'admin'
        and 'adminInfra' accounts.
        If 'y' is selected, it sets the default usernames and passwords as follows:
            user       : password
            =====================
            admin      : admin
            adminInfra : admin
            testUser   : testUser

    b. Container filesystem directory: [ default: /opt/rce/container ]
        The purposes and contents of the directories are as follows.
            directory   - description
            =========================
            path/rootfs - Contains the root filesystem of the container
            path/data   - Contains temporary data for each container instance
            path/config - Contains configuration data for each container instance
        Note : 'path' here refers to the selected path.

    c. External communication interface: [ default: eth0 ]
        The globally accessible network interface:
            For AWS EC2 set it to:   aws_dns
            For Rackspace set it to: eth0
            Alternately provide the IPv4 address for the corresponding interface: x.x.x.x

    d. Internal communication interface: [ default: eth0 ]
        The network interface used to communicate between the nodes of the cloud engine.
        This could be the same network interface as for the external communication, but
        often varies. Especially in specialized setups of IaaS platforms such as EC2 or
        Rackspace this distinction is made, because the internal networks generally have
        much lower latencies and higher speeds which could massively benefit the cloud engine.
            For AWS EC2 set it to:   eth0
            For Rackspace set it to: eth1
            Alternately provide the IPv4 address for the corresponding interface: x.x.x.x

    e. Internal container communication interface : [ default: lxcbr0 ]
        The network interface used to communicate between the containers on the same
        physical host/cloud instance (It is not the same as [d])
        Unless specialized lxc setups are carried out, this would be lxcbr0.


Prerequisites
=============

    sudo apt-get install git-core python-dev python-setuptools


Installation
============

I. Fetch and Install RCE:

    1. Grab the source:
         git clone https://github.com/IDSCETHZurich/rce.git
    2. Run the install script:
         cd rce
         sudo ./install.sh
         (This will build and install all dependencies and packages to run the
         RoboEarth cloud engine)

II. Setup the cloud engine.

    1. Navigate to the source directory
         cd rce [or the location where you cloned the source]
    2. Run the provisioning script
         ./setup/provision all
