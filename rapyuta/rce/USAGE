Server-side
===========

Assuming that the cloud engine was successfully installed in the suggested
directories one can use the following commands to start the cloud engine.

The first step is to start the Master process
    rce-master

The second step is to start the Robot and Container processes as needed. It is
important to note that for each machine there can be only one Container process
as well as only one Robot process (planned to allow more than one Robot process
per machine in the future).
    rce-robot [IP address of Master process]
    sudo rce-container [IP address of Master process]

Note: The Robot process needs a properly set-up ROS environment
      (i.e. run /opt/rce/fuerte/setup.sh )

Client-side
===========

As an example on how to use the RoboEarth Cloud Engine from the perspective of
the client-side a short example using the ROS client in the following.

The first step is to set up the ROS environment
    . /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh
    ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/opt/rce/test
    roscore

Now, the system is ready to launch the ROS client using the configuration file
'debug.cfg'.
Note: Modify the url of the configuration file according to your settings.
    rce-ros test/debug.cfg

After a few seconds the Cloud Engine should be ready to receive messages. The
Master process should report (to stdout for now) the following line 'Connection
to Environment process established.', after which the Cloud Engine is ready. To
test the different connections:

- Test Service
    $ rosservice call /stringEchoService "Hello World"
    data: Hello World

- Test Publisher/Subscriber
    $ rostopic echo /stringEchoResp &
    $ rostopic pub -r 1 /stringEchoReq std_msgs/String "Hello World"
    data: Hello World
    ---
    data: Hello World
    ---
    ...

- Test Parameter Server (returned values can be modified by editing the
  configuration file 'debug.cfg')
    $ rosservice call /parameterTest
    msg: int:   99
    str:   Hello World
    float: 3.14
    bool:  True
    array: ['one', 2, 'three', 'true']
