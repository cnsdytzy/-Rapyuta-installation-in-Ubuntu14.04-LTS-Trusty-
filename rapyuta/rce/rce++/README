rce++ is a header only client with dependencies on Boost, websocketpp, curl, and
openssl.

Dependencies

            - successfully compiled and linked with 1.52
            - default boost library 1.46 of ubuntu 12.04 is insufficient

    curl & openssl:

Necessary libaries to link against
==================================

    LDLIBS=-lboost_system -lboost_regex -lboost_random -lboost_thread

Test the client
===============

    To test the rce++ client:
      1. Build the test application (configure Makefile as necessary)

           cd test
           make

      2. Use the ROS client (rce-ros) to setup the container for
         the rce++ test (ROS client needs a working ROS environment).

           rce-ros ../../test/debug.cfg

      3. Run the test application

           ./test [IP address of cloud engine]

         The test should send and receive "Hello World!" messages which can
         be checked using the command

           rostopic echo /stringEchoReq

         to check what is sent and the command

           rostopic echo /stringEchoResp

         to check was is received from the cloud engine.
