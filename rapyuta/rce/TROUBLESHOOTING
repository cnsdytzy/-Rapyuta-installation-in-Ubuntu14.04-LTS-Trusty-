TROUBLESHOOTING file of the RoboEarth Cloud Engine
--------------------------------------

TS1.	Where do I find the logs ?
	The framework logs can be found:
		Currently flushed to the sys.stdout and you can pipe it to a file if needed or
		modify rce-core/rce/master.py, rce-core/rce/robot.py, or rce-core/rce/container.py to
		change output permanently to a file.
		
	Container level logs can be found inside:
		/opt/rce/container/data/<container-name>/rce/env.log        # Environment process

TS2.	How do find more information on running containers ?
	The command [lxc-ls] lists all the running containers.
